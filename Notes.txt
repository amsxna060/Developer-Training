The switch cases without break, return, or goto statement or 
with the same constant values would give a compile-time error.

case 1: // Error - Control cannot fall through from one case label ('case 1:') to another
        Console.WriteLine($"{x} is odd Value");

1. The switch statement is an alternative to if else statement.
2. The switch statement tests a match expression/variable against a set of constants specified as cases.
3. The switch case must include break, return, goto keyword to exit a case.
4. The switch can include one optional default label, which will be executed when no case executed.
5. C# compiler will give errors on missing :, constant value with cases, exit from a case.
6. C# 7.0 onward, switch cases can include non-unique values. In this case, the first matching case will be executed.


for loop, 
// it can also use any numeric datatype like float double etc.
for (double d = 1.01D; d < 1.10; d+= 0.01D)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Value of i: {0}", d);
}

A for loop can also contain statements as an initializer and iterator.
loop body can we empty.
